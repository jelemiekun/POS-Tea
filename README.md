OVERVIEW
- POS (Point of Sale) System
This software is designed to efficiently handle various aspects of a business, including inventory 
management, sales tracking, and seamless integration with other crucial operations such as accounting and customer relationship management.

- Purpose
The purpose of its creation was to innovate the order process of the Eats Braudy’s milk tea shop by providing a platform for managing various orders. With this user-friendly system, you can efficiently track your overall transactions between the owner and the customer.

INTRODUCTION
- As part of our project in our computer programming subject we are tasked to look for stores or businesses that do not have any system. Then we found the Eats Bru Day Milk Tea Shop and we created this POS-Tea system to make their transaction easier between the owner and customer.

FEATURES

- The features of the POS-Tea system are the following:
- It shows the overall product of the shop like milk tea, coolers, coffee, candy cups, and appetizers.
- It illustrates the customer's overall sequence of transactions.
- This feature provides a comprehensive overview of the customer's transactions, spanning from the present moment to their entire history, allowing for a clear and detailed understanding of their financial activity.
-  It displays comprehensive data on total revenue, customer count, order volume, and popular menu categories, showcasing the top-performing items of the establishment.
-  It’s the overall access to the system in which the user can manipulate the system. 
- It shows the theme or color of the system which the user wants to use.
- These features of the POS-Tea system can be used to add products and delete products.
